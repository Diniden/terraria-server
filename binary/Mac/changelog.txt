	These shards deal damage to enemies at close range, and inflict knockback.
	Use them defensively to keep enemies away, or for the bold, aggressively to inflict extra damage.

	New Set Bonus: Holy Protection
	Familiar to most users as Shadow Dodge, Hallowed has had its previously stat-based set bonus replaced with a periodic immunity to damage.

	Instead of 30% damage reduction whenever you have charges, you now have 12% damage reduction at all times, and 20% additional damage reduction while charges are active. In practice, this is roughly equivalent to the same 30% it used to give due to how the two values are multiplied.
	Recharge time between shield charges reduced by 1 second

	Stardust Armor

	Gold Shortsword damage increased from 11 to 12

	Flails
	Flails now have entirely new behavior, and a few different functionality modes.
	If you click and hold the mouse button, they will swing around rapidly, doing low knock back and hitting rapidly in a small circle around you.
	If you click and use them normally, you will shoot them forward similar to how they use to be used, but they will move much faster than they did before. The damage dealt is double in this mode.
	Finally, if you click while it is in midair after having shot it forward, it will drop suddenly and lay on the ground. This can be used as a stationary damaging obstacle like a Spiky Ball on enemies walking towards you.
	Some flails have had some stat tweaks to fit with this new setup, such as having slightly longer or shorter range, but generally speaking, all of them should perform better than before.

	Daedalus Stormbow

	When using Holy, Unholy, Hellfire, or Jester arrows, shoots an average of 2.66 arrows, instead of the normal average of 3.33 arrows

	Poison Staff
	Note: Previously, due to piercing immunity frames, only one projectile from each shot would hit each target, resulting in a lot of lost damage. We've implemented a system that allows ALL of the projectiles to hit a target, dramatically improving its shotgun-like functionality. However, to offset this gain, it has had to have some of its stats reduced. On the whole, this should now be a stronger weapon, however.

	When enemies are in range, it will constantly attack any nearby enemies, consuming mana for each attack.
	Can hit up to 3 targets with each attack (does not consume extra mana)
	Damage is now set to 40
	Mana cost has been decreased from 18 to 15, however, it can now fire up to 4 times per second, increasing the speed at which it consumes mana

	Damage decreased from 63 to 44
	Reduced number of enemies that each projectile can hit from 7 to 5
	Applies a 25% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy a projectile pierces
	Now has a range before projectiles die, 50% longer than Poison Staff's

	Wasp Gun
	Note: This may sound like a nerf on paper, but it trades "hit count" for total damage, and will actually result in dramatically more DPS for the Wasp Gun. Less Wasps, more damage.
	Damage increased from 21 to 31
	Use Time increased from 11 to 18
	Wasps can now bounce/pierce only 3 times instead of 4
	Wasps per Cast: Reduced to an average of 3
	Mana cost increased from 6 to 10

	Nettle Burst
	Damage increased from 28 to 35

	Now has a 20% critical chance
	Mana Cost increased from 15 to 18

	Projectile speed greatly increased, as a result, has better range and much harder to fall below the minimum threshold to maintain maximum damage

	Damage increased from 55 to 80
	Use Time decreased from 16 to 10
	Can no longer pierce and hit multiple enemies

	Bat Scepter
	Average Bats per cast increased from 2 to 2.5

	This weapon still charges, but it now fires constantly while charging.
	For the first second of charging, you will fire 6 single-target pellets, each dealing a base damage of 100 (up from 50)
	For the next two seconds, you will fire 3 total piercing blasts, each dealing a base damage of 250 (up from 100)
	After this, it will shoot the laser beam, which is unchanged from the original implementation
	You can also quick-fire pellets without charging. The fire rate of these pellets is much higher than the previous implementation.
	The mana cost of charging is unchanged, however, quick firing will naturally consume more mana as the fire rate has increased significantly.

	Nebula Blaze
	Use Time decreased from 15 to 12
	Mana cost decreased from 18 to 12

G. Summons:
	Summoned minions now adjust their damage dynamically based on your current equipment and damage buffs

	"Some (though not all) Summons now use their own damage immunity timer system. In practice, what this means is that they will no longer interfere with the use of other weapons by maxing out the enemy's immunity frames. All affected minions are set on their own damage timer to most correctly match their pre-change DPS, but some changes are to be expected comparing 1.3.5 DPS to 1.4 DPS. In general, even if there is some minor loss or gain of DPS compared to pre-change performance, it should be worth the improvement to overall performance. Examples of minions impacted by this change:
	- Slime Staff
	- Spider Staff
	- Pirate Staff
	- Optic Staff
	- Raven Staff
	- Deadly Sphere Staff
	- Stardust Dragon Staff
	- Some of the new summons also utilize this system"

	Titan Glove and its tinkers now give autoswing to all Melee Weapons (and Whips!)

	Wing Balance has been heavily balanced across the entirety of the game.
	With only a few exceptions, wings found at the same tier should be roughly equivalent in power. Exceptions are usually particularly hard or particularly easy to get.
	Unfortunately, its difficult to share exact stats for wings, partially because there are dozens of them that have been changed, and their stats don't easily translate to easily readable stats.
	The best short summary is that over a dozen sets of wings were buffed, and that Leaf and Frozen Wings have been reduced in power, as they were too strong for their tier.
	Other major notes:

Version 1.3.4   Changes-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:
	Dungeon Defenders 2 Cross-Over Invasion
		Invasion event featuring enemies, weapons, and gameplay mechanics inspired by Etheria - the Dungeon Defenders 2 universe
		This event will play like no other in Terraria - featuring a brand new mechanic where you protect an artifact from invading enemies with the help of a unique defensive structure system
		Multi-tiered event allows players at multiple points in the game to experience scaling difficulty, with corresponding loot
		Enjoy rewards in the form of armor, weapons, pets and more, all straight from the Dungeon Defenders 2 universe!
	The Tavernkeep, a new NPC from the Dungeon Defenders universe, has arrived.  He will be offering a variety of Etherian loot and gear in exchange for an exclusive currency earned by playing the new invasion!
	Completely redesigned liquid visuals. Enjoy the ripples and waves, as the player, enemies, and projectiles now have a visible impact when they enter and move through water
	The Blizzard weather event now has a new, unique ambient sound when active
	Toggles for recently-added visual and water effects that will allow players to balance beautiful visuals and performance to fit their preferences
	A new ability for Summoner players to direct their minions to attack a specific target
	An experimental new world seed feature (This will be inactive by default, see below in the Changes section for more details)

Items:
	Added four new sentry summons, each of which has three tiers of potency
	Added ten new weapons
	Eight new armor sets
	Added five new accessories
	Added two new pets
	Added one new light pet
	Added three new boss masks and trophies
	Added two new decorate furniture items
	Added one brand new “Personal Safe” style furniture item, in the style of the Piggy Bank and Safe
	Added a brand new currency which can be spent with the Tavernkeep for much of the above
	
Enemies:
	Added ten new enemies, many of which can become visibly (and mechanically) more powerful as gameplay progresses
	Added two new invasion style mini-bosses
	Added one new boss	

Other:
	Added one new soundtrack based on the Dungeon Defenders 2 OST, complete with a matching Music Box
	
Changes:
	It no longer rains in the space biome.
	Summoners can now direct their minions to attack a specific target of their choosing. To do this, the summoner must Right Click over an enemy while holding a summoning staff. Minions with line of sight on that enemy will target it immediately. However, if the minions do not have line of sight, they will continue to attack targets at random.
	The way Sentry Summons function has been changed somewhat.
		Outside of the DD2 Invasion event, you now have a limit of one sentry summon at a time
		Some of the 1.3.4 content can increase this limit
		Unlike before, when the sentry limit is above 1, you can summon multiple versions of the same sentry. For instance, with a sentry limit of 3, you could summon 3 Frost Hydras at the same time.
	We’ve added an experimental new seed feature to World generation. All worlds generated in 1.3.4 and beyond will have a seed attached to them. You will also be able to set the seed for a world on world generation. PLEASE NOTE that this feature is not active by default. To activate it, please follow these steps:
		Find Terraria’s config.json file. On Windows, this should be found in Documents>My Games>Terraria.
		Open the config file with a basic text editing program, such as Notepad.
		The 12th line in the config file is labeled “"UseExperimentalFeatures" and will be set to “false”.
		Simply change this to “true” and save the config.json file. The next time you launch Terraria, the option to view and set world seeds will appear.
	Please be aware that this is NOT a retroactive feature, and cannot display the seeds for worlds created before 1.3.4, as the data is simply not stored there.
